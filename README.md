 I'm making a career shift from project coordination to web development. With a background in program coordination, administration, and teaching, along with degrees in Nutrition and Dietetics, and Business Administration, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. I'm currently enrolled in a tech boot camp to become a full stack developer, focusing on web development. I'm passionate about coding because it allows me to solve problems creatively and continuously learn new things. I'm excited to contribute to innovative projects and grow in this dynamic field.




Skills: Python/ JS / HTML / CSS
